BERT Console
============

Updated console for [BERT][1] based on [electron][2] and [codemirror][3].

Directory structure:

```
bert-shell      build and config files
├── ext         third-party resources
├── src       
│   ├── data    imported data files
│   ├── root    non-bundled source and base files
│   ├── script  bundled script files
│   ├── style   bundled css files
```

in addition a `build/` directory will be created by webpack.
