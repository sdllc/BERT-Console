Welcome to the BERT console! The console includes an R command shell
and a basic editor for editing your function or script files.

A couple of key things to know:

 * BERT loads functions from files in `My Documents\BERT\functions`
   (we call this the startup folder). When you install, there's
   one file in there: `functions.R`. To add new functions to Excel,
   either edit that file or add a new file to the startup folder.
   
 * Any time you add or change a file in the startup folder, BERT 
   will reload it automatically.  You can watch other files and 
   directories as well; see the docs on watching files.

 * The R shell is "live" and connected to Excel -- see the docs on 
   Talking to Excel from R, and the Excel Scripting (COM) Interface.

This editor, and the R command shell, are built using CodeMirror and
Electron.  This is a complicated stack but the end result should be 
very easy to use, configurable and extensible.  

You don't have to use our editor -- use any editor you like.  You
can hide this editor in the **View** menu, and just use the command
shell.

Have suggestions, feedback, questions, comments?  Let us know!  

Cheers,
